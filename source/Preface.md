## What?

**`edk2-sdm845`** is a project which enables you to load any AArch64 EFI-compatible OS/application, such as Windows, Linux etc *(more precisely, they're Windows Boot Manager and GNU Grub)* on your sdm845 mobile devices.

To be honest, I'd rather call it a piece of **broken** *software* than regard it as *firmware* or *bootloader*, as its functionality is extremely limited. You cannot interact with it at runtime at all. Also, it relies on binary executables from Qualcomm. The use of those files is of doubtful legality. **You have been warned.**

## When?

*Thanks to COVID-19*, I made enough leisure time to spend on my computer, which opened up the possibility for me to discover a Github Repository called *edk2-sagit*. I rapidly became intoxicated with the possibility of running a fully-functional Windows Desktop on my phone. So I set about working on my port.

During the process, I was particularly fortunate that I came across some people who had the same ambition as mine, such as NekokeCore, RedStonee, Evsio0n... Even though some of us were high school students who were short of time and knowledge, we still went on out of interest. We knew nothing about QCOM platform, AArch64 architecture, Linux kernel internals, even nothing about programming *(eg. myself)*. But there's no problem at all.

Afterwards a Telegram/Discord group was created for English-speaking guys. Many people were friendly and deserved the credit for offering a helping hand, specifically imbushuo, fxsheep, NTAuthority, Lemon_Ice, TAO_Croatia... Again, thank you so much for your help.

## Why?
